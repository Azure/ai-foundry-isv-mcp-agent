# Snowflake Managed MCP Server
The Snowflake-managed MCP server is a recommended approach to securely interact with Snowflake's data and AI services without requiring separate MCP Server deployment. This managed service supports:

- **Standardized Integration**: Unified interface for tool discovery and invocation compliant with MCP standards
- **Comprehensive Authentication**: Built-in OAuth service for secure MCP integrations  
- **Robust Governance**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for server and tool management
- **Scalable Architecture**: Enterprise-grade applications with maintained access and privacy controls

## Setup
Please follow the Snowflake Documentation to setup the Managed MCP Server
